############### Running the File ####################

To run the train file, you should navigate to the root folder of the project and type node tremAutonomo.js.

############### Running the Unit Test File ####################

To run the unit test file, you should be in the root repository and execute the command npx jest.

(Important: Install the dependencies with npm i)

Note: Remember that to run the unit test, you need to install the Jest library. Again,
make sure you are in the root folder, and before running the first command (node tremAutonomo.js), run this command if npm i doesn't solve it: npm install jest.
